<h1>Java Platform Debugger Architecture - Example JDI Applications</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>For v1.3.0 and later releases, the Java 2 SDK's <tt>demo/jpda</tt>
directory contains source code and documentation for three applications
written using
the Java Debug Interface (JDI) of the <a
href="/products/jpda/index.jsp">Java Platform Debugger Architecture</a>
(JPDA). They are provided as educational tools and as starting points
for debugger development. (For J2SE 1.2.2, the example applications may
be obtained from the JPDA <a href="/products/jpda/download.html">download
page</a>.)
</p>
<p>
In increasing order of complexity:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="trace.html">Trace</a> displays traces of program
execution. It is very simple (less than 600 lines) yet uses most of the
basic JDI functionality. It is a good starting point.</li>
<li><a href="jdb.html">Jdb</a> is the command line debugger
distributed with the J2SE SDK v1.3 and later releases.</li>
<li><a href="javadt.html">Javadt</a> is the beginnings of a GUI
debugger.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Trace is in the <code>trace</code> directory. Jdb and Javadt share a
package, and are in the <code>debuggers</code> directory. </p>

<a name="SETUP"></a>
<h2>Required Set-up</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Your classpath must include the JDI Library code, which is in <code>lib/tools.jar</code>
directory of the Java 2 SDK. (Note that <tt>tools.jar</tt> is not in
the Java Runtime Environment; it is only in the Java 2 SDK.)
This is needed for both compiling the example code and executing it.
For information on how to set the classpath, see the <a
href="/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/index.html">J2SE tools documentation</a>.
