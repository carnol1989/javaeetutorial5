<h2>JConsole and JMX Remote Management</h2>
<ol>
<li><a name="win1"><b>
I run JConsole on Windows. Why does the Local tab in Connect 
dialog not list any Java process?</b></a>

<p>
The problem is most likely that your default Windows temporary directory is 
on a FAT file system. If your TMP file system is NTFS and JConsole 
does not show your processes, check your username as described in 
<a href="#win2">FAQ #2</a>.

<p>
For security reasons, local monitoring and 
management is only supported if your default Windows temporary directory is 
on a file system that supports setting permissions on files and directories
(for example, on an NTFS file system).  It is not supported on a FAT file 
system that provide insufficient access controls.
<p>
A potential workaround for this issue:<br>
Set the TMP environment variable to refer to a directory on an NTFS file 
system, or any file system that supports setting permissions on files 
and directories before you run your application with local or remote 
management enabled. 
Note that this file system should be local to the machine. Setting this option 
for target applications is application specific. To set this variable in a 
command prompt or in a batch script, simply enter the following:
<p>
set TMP=<i>path</i>
<p>
The environment variable can be set globally by adding it to the list of 
environment variables in the System Properties (Control Panel->System, 
select the "Advanced" tab and click on the "Environment Variables" button). 
Through this interface, you can choose to set the variable for all processes 
run by the current user or globally as a system variable for all processes run 
by the system.

<p>
It is a known problem in JDK 5 that jconsole and jps commands do not
work on Windows if your username contains '_' (underscore). Bug

  JConsole fails to connect to an application remotely
  or locally running on the same machine using the Remote Tab.

  machine.</b></a>

<p>
It is most likely a configuration problem. First, make sure your application
was started with remote management enabled.  (See details from the
<a href="agent.html">"Monitoring and Management using JMX"</a> document.)
Second, check if SSL is enabled in the management properties to 
enable remote management and if it is configured properly.
<p>
SSL is enabled by default when the remote management is enabled.
You can disable SSL by setting <tt>com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl</tt> 
property to <tt>false</tt>. 
If your application is not set up with SSL properly but SSL is enabled 
for remote management, JConsole will fail to connect to the application.
Please see <a href="agent.html#SSL_enabled">"Using SSL"</a> section 
in the "Monitoring and Management Using JMX" document for information
about using SSL for remote management.
<p>
If the connection failure problem occurs only when your application
runs on <b>Linux</b>, please see <a href="#linux1">FAQ #5</a>.
<p>
</li>

<li><a name="linux1"><b>
  I am having problem using JConsole to connect to a JVM 
  running on Linux.  Connecting to JVM running on Windows and Solaris 
  works fine.</b></a>

<p>
This is most likely a configuration problem on the Linux machine or 
the management properties specified to run the application. 
Please also see <a href="#config1">FAQ #4</a> about using SSL.
<p>
You should check the following:
<ul>
<li>
Check if the hostname correctly resolves to the host address.
<p>
Run <tt>"hostname -i"</tt> command.  If it reports 127.0.0.1, JConsole 
would not be able to connect to the JVM running on that Linux machine.
To fix this issue, edit /etc/hosts so that the hostname resolves to the host 
address.
</li>

<li>Check if the Linux machine is configured to accept packets from 
the host where JConsole runs on to connect to the application.
<p>
Packet filtering is built in the Linux kernel.  You can run <tt>"/sbin/iptables --list"</tt> to determine if an external client is allowed to connect to 
the JMX agent created for remote management.
You can use the following command to add a rule to allow an external client 
such as JConsole to connect:
<p>
<tt>
/usr/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s <i>jconsole-host</i> -p tcp --destination-port 
<i>jmxremote-port</i> -j ACCEPT
</tt>
<p>
where <i>jconsole-host</i> is either the hostname or the host address 
on which JConsole runs on and <i>jmxremote-port</i> is the port number
set for <tt>com.sun.management.jmxremote.port</tt> for remote management.
</li>
</ul>
<p></li>

<li><a name="ssl1"><b>
  My application has remote management enabled with SSL.
  How to setup JConsole to connect to my application?</b></a>
<p>

When you enable the application for remote management with SSL,  
you have set up a digital certificate on the system 
where the JMX agent (MBean server) is running and configured SSL
properly. 
<p>
Assuming you created a keystore as 
described in the <a href="../security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#CreateKeystore">
JSSE Guide</a> and started your application (<tt>Server</tt>) as follows: 
<blockquote><pre>
% java -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=keystore \<br>  -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=password Server<br>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To connect to this application, you need to run jconsole as follows:
<blockquote><pre>
% jconsole -J-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=truststore \<br>  -J-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=trustword<br>
</pre></blockquote>

The above configuration authenticates the server only. If client authentication is set up, you will need to provide a similar keystore for the JConsole's keys, and an appropriate truststore for the application.

  How to export the remote objects for the RMI connector
  on a given port different than the port being used to 
  bind the <tt>RMIConnectorServer</tt> to the <tt>RMIRegistry</tt>?</b></a>
<p>
The <tt>com.sun.management.jmxremote.port</tt> management property specifies
the port number through which you want to enable JMX/RMI connections. It
is the port number for binding <tt>RMIConnectionServer</tt> to the 
<tt>RMIRegistry</tt>.
To export the remote objects (<tt>RMIConnection</tt> and 
<tt>RMIServer</tt>) on a given port other than the one for 
<tt>RMIRegistry</tt>, you can create your own 
RMI connector server programmatically as follows:
<blockquote><tt>
JMXServiceURL url = new JMXServiceURL("service:jmx:rmi://localhost:" +
  <i>port1</i> + "/jndi/rmi://localhost:" + <i>port2</i> + "/server");
</tt></blockquote>
where <i>port1</i> is the port number on which the 
<tt>RMIServer</tt> and <tt>RMIConnection</tt> remote objects are exported 
and <i>port2</i> is the port number for binding 
the <tt>RMIConnectorServer</tt> to the <tt>RMIRegistry</tt>.

<h2>SNMP Based Management</h2>

<ol>
<li><a name="snmp1"><b>
  Where can I find the standard MIB for SNMP management
  of the Java virtual machine? What version of SNMP protocol does it require?
  </b></a> 

<p>
The standard MIB for the Java virtual machine can be found at:
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/JVM-MANAGEMENT-MIB.mib">
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/JVM-MANAGEMENT-MIB.mib</a>.
Some objects exposed in the JVM MIB are 64-bit quantities.
To see these objects, you need to use the SNMP v2 protocol.
If you can walk the JVM MIB using SNMP v1 protocol, the 64-bit objects are
skipped.
</li>

<li><a name="snmp2"><b>
  I'm not able to see all objects the JVM MIB tree. For
  example,  the jvmMemoryHeapUsed OID is missing. Is it a known problem?
  </b></a>
<p>
The JVM MIB includes 64-bit objects which require to use the SNMP v2 protocol.
All the 64-bit objects are skipped if you walk the JVM MIB using SNMP v1.
</li>


<li><a name="snmp3"><b>
  I'm having trouble getting the SNMP feature in J2SE 5.0 to start for my JVM. The argument makes it into the Java environment via <tt>pargs PID</tt>, but a <tt>netstat -na | grep PORT</tt> doesn't show anything. What am I doing wrong?
  </b></a>
<p>This problem could be caused by one of the following factors:

<ul>
<li>The ACL file is not found, not readable, or does not have the appropriate permissions (although you should be seeing some warnings in this case).</li>
<li>The port you are trying to bind to is already in use (you should also see an error in this case).</li>
<li>The <tt>management.properties</tt> file (or ACL file) which is used is not the one that you intended. For example, if you misspelled the property when you invoked it, the JVM will not recognize it and will use its own <tt>management.properties</tt> file instead.</li>
<li>There is a host address mismatch (0.0.0.0 vs localhost vs hostname). By default you can only receive UDP packets that come from the loopback interface, unless you explicitly bind to the 0.0.0.0 or to the actual IP address (see NOTE below).</li>
<li>The content of the ACL file is not appropriate, for example you have granted access to the loopback address, but you are using the actual host address to send packets, or conversely.</li>
<li>You are trying to walk the MIB from an OID which is already beyond the scope of the JVM-MANAGEMENT-MIB, or you are stopping the walk before the  JVM-MANAGEMENT-MIB is reached. Some SNMP walk commands have an implied starting point which might already be beyond the scope of the JVM-MANAGEMENT-MIB, or have an implied stopping point which is before the JVM-MANAGEMENT-MIB.

<p>Make sure your snmpwalk utility starts walking at 'sun', which is 1.3.6.1.4.1.42 (otherwise known as enterprises.42), and does not stop before that subtree is exhausted. As an alternative, try to perform a simple SNMP get on the following OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.145.3.163.1.1.4.1 (aka jvmRTName).
</li>

</ul>
<p>Before attempting to modify the ACL file, try out a connection with SNMP ACLs disabled, by using the following option:
<p><tt>-Dcom.sun.management.snmp.acl=false</tt>
<p>Once this works, you can try to set up the ACL configuration.

<p><b>NOTE</b>: If you want to be able to receive packets that come both from the loopback interface (127.0.0.1=localhost) and the actual host IP (x.y.z.w=<i>hostname</i>) you need to bind to 0.0.0.0 (com.sun.management.snmp.interface=0.0.0.0). See the <tt>com.sun.management.snmp.interface</tt> in <tt>management.properties</tt>.

<p>You must then configure the ACL file to accept both addresses (or disable the ACL file completely).
