<h1>Java Platform Debugger Architecture</h1>
<p><b>Trace</b> runs the Java language program passed as an argument
and
generates a trace of its execution. <b>Trace</b> is a simple command
line tool that uses the Java Debug Interface (JDI). Programs need
not be compiled for debugging since this information is not
used.
</p>
<p>
<b>Trace</b> can be invoked as follows:
</p>
<pre>        java Trace <i>options class args</i><br></pre>
Your classpath must include the Java 2 SDK's <tt>lib/tools.jar</tt>
file which contains the JDI Library
(see <a href="examples.html#SETUP">set-up</a>),
the path to the compiled <b>trace</b> class files,
and the path for the application being traced.
<p>
Available <i>options</i> are:
<!-- BEGIN VCD7 CODE SAMPLE COMPONENT  -->
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%"
class="grey4">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>  -output <i>filename</i><br>        Set destination for output trace. By default output<br>        goes to the terminal.<br><br>  -all<br>        Include system classes in output.  By default<br>        java.*, javax.*, sun.* and com.sun.* events are<br>        not diplayed.<br><br>  -fields<br>        Also show assignments into fields.<br><br>  -help<br>        Print a help message<br><br>      </pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<span class="sp20"> </span><br>
<!-- END VCD7 CODE SAMPLE COMPONENT  -->
<i>class</i> is the program to trace. <i>args</i> are the arguments to
<i>class</i>.
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Source for trace</h2>
<p>
Full source code for <b>trace</b> is included in the
<code>trace</code> directory of <code>examples.jar</code>.
Source code of these example application is included to provide
concrete
examples for debugger developers. Example code may be used, modified
and redistributed by debugger developers providing they adhere to the
terms in the copyright notice.
</p>
<h2>Building trace</h2>
<p>
To completely rebuild the <b>trace</b> classes from the
provided source files in the <code>trace</code> directory,
you need only to compile them. No special
options are required, aside from those which set your classpath to
include the <a href="examples.html#SETUP">JDI Library</a> in <tt>lib/tools.jar</tt>.
