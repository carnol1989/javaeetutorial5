    <h2>Java Accessibility API</h2>

    <blockquote>
      The Java Accessibility API (JAAPI) is one of the core parts
      of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC). The JFC are a
      comprehensive set of graphical user interface components and
      foundation services designed to simplify deployment of
      Internet, intranet and desktop applications. The JAAPI makes
      GUI component information available to assistive
      technologies, giving users alternative presentation and
      control of Java applications.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Java Accessibility Utilities</h2>

    <blockquote>
      The <a
      href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/jaccess-1.3/doc/index.html">
      Java Accessibility Utilities</a> help assistive technologies
      take advantage of the Java Accessibility API. The Utilities
      monitor events related to UI components. They also help
      assistive technologies get additional information about a
      GUI, such as the current position of the mouse, or the window
      that currently has focus. 

      <p>The Utilities are released separately from the JFC, but
      they can be downloaded from the <a
      href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.jsp">JFC Home
      Page</a>.</p>

    <h2>Pluggable Look and Feel</h2>

    <blockquote>
      The Java Foundation Classes implement a Pluggable Look and
      Feel architecture. This architecture allows non-visual
      manifestations of a user interface to replace or enhance the
      visual presentation of an application. The expression of the
      user interface is separated from the underlying structure and
      data of each individual component. This is accomplished by
      separating the user interface of the component from its
      model. The model of a component is the structure which
      encapsulates the state and information that is presented to
      the user by the user interface. More information on this
      architecture can be found in <a
      href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/">The Swing
      Connection</a>.
