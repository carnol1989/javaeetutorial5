<h1>Cookie Management</h1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>The HTTP state management mechanism specifies a way to create a
stateful session with HTTP requests and responses. The specification
for it can be found in RFC 2965: HTTP State Management Mechanism at
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2965.txt?number=2965">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2965.txt?number=2965.</a></P>
<h2>Pre-Tiger support</h2>
<P>Prior
to Tiger, it was possible to add Cookie management to applications.
But the supporting API was somewhat rudimentary.
There was no single point of hook up with cookie management.
Each application had to handle cookies for each HTTP
request/response separately by using the following two methods from
java.net.URLConnection class:
<P><code>setRequestProperty()<br>
getHeaderFields()</code></P>
<P>The first method should be called before sending out a HTTP request in
order to set the appropriate cookies for the current URL in the HTTP
headers. The second method should be used to
retrieve the cookies from the response headers sent by the HTTP server.
<P>Although
doable, adding Cookie support in this way results in
fragmented code, which is error prone and incurs high maintenance.</P>
<h2>What's new in Tiger?</h2>
<P>We
have introduced a new callback mechanism via an abstract class to
hook up a HTTP state management policy implementation into the HTTP
protocol handler. Applications and web containers can introduce
Cookie management by providing a concrete subclass of the new API.</P>
<P>The new abstract class is called java.net.CookieHandler. It provides
a mechanism to register and retrieve the current CookieHandler
for the JVM, as well as methods to retrieve and record relevant cookies for a
specific URI.
<P>There
are two static methods in CookieHandler getDefault() and
setDefault() for retrieving and registering the default CookieHandler
in the VM. As well as two instance methods get() and put() for
returning a list of cookies based on a URL and stores a list of
cookies from the response headers, respectively.</P>
<P>Cookies
are represented as Map&lt;String,List&lt;String&gt;&gt;, a Map from
the header field name for cookies to a list of cookies represented by
Strings.
There are two state management headers defined so far,
&quot;Set-Cookie2&quot; and &quot;Cookie&quot;. The former is used for 
returning cookies in response headers; while the latter is for setting 
cookies in HTTP request headers.</P>
<P>Here is an example from RFC2965:</p>
<P>1.  User Agent -&gt; Server</P>
<P>        POST /acme/login HTTP/1.1<br>
	       [form data]</P>
<P>2.  Server -&gt; User Agent</P>
<P>        HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>
           Set-Cookie2: Customer="WILE_E_COYOTE"; Version="1"; Path="/acme"</P>
<P>3.  User Agent -&gt; Server</P>
<P>        POST /acme/pickitem HTTP/1.1<br>
           Cookie: $Version="1"; Customer="WILE_E_COYOTE"; $Path="/acme"<br>
           [form data]</P>
<h2>A simple Example</h2>
<P>Here's a simple example of a CookieHandler implementation. Basically
there are two methods to implement, given a request URI and request
headers (except the cookie headers), retrieve all the relevant
cookies from your cookie cache; and record the applicable cookies to
your cookie cache given the request URI and the response headers.</P>
<pre>
class MyCookieHandler extends CookieHandler {
	public Map&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt;
		get(URI uri, Map&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt; requestHeaders)
		throws IOException {
		// the cookies will be included in request
		Map&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt;();
		List&lt;String&gt; l = retrieveCookies(uri, rqstHdrs);
		map.put(&quot;Cookie&quot;,l);
		return Collections.unmodifiableMap(map);
	}

	public void
		put(URI uri, Map responseHeaders)
		throws IOException {
	    // check response has cookies[1]
		List l = (List)responseHeaders.get(&quot;Set-Cookie2&quot;);
	    if (l != null) {
			// save the cookies in a cookie cache
		 storeCookies(uri, l);
	    }
	}
}
</pre>
<P>The methods <code>retrieveCookies()</code>
and <code>storeCookies()</code> are "magic"
functions for interacting with a backend cookie management facility,
which is omitted in this example.</P>
<P>Once it is registered with the VM, it will take effect when you issue HTTP
transactions.</P>
<pre>
public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {
	......
	CookieHandler.setDefault(new MyCookieHandler());
	HttpURLConnection http = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();

	int respCode = http.getResponseCode();
	http.disconnect();
	......
}
</pre>
<P>There is no default implementation of a cookie manager in J2SE.
However, this may change in the future. Java Plugin and Java
WebStart provides a default CookieHandler in their environment.
