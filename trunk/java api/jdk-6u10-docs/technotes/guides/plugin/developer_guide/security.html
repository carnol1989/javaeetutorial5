Applet Security Basics</h2>
<p>Below are the basic facts regarding applet security and Java
Plug-in. More details can be found in the next chapter, <a
 href="rsa_how.html">Verification of  RSA Signed Applets in Java Plug-in</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>All <u>unsigned applets</u> are run under the standard applet
security model.</li>
  <li>If <code><a href="rsa_how.html#use">usePolicy</a></code> <strong>is not defined</strong> in the <code>java.policy</code> file, then a <u>signed applet</u>
has the <code>AllPermission</code> permission only if Java Plug-in can
verify the signers, and the user
agrees to granting the <code>AllPermission</code> permission when prompted. </li>
  <li>If <code>usePolicy</code> is <strong>defined</strong>, then a <u>signed applet</u>
has only the permissions defined in <code>java.policy</code> and no
prompting occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, note that Java Plug-in now handles certificate management;
i.e., the certificate verification task is no longer passed on to the
browser.<br>
</p>
<h2><b>Running Signed Applets on Windows Vista</b></h2>
<p>Signed applets on Windows Vista have less privileges compared
to the applets running on other Windows operating systems such as
Windows XP Home or Windows XP Professional. This is due to the fact that browser process  has low level of integrity. Low level
integrity
implies lesser privileges
than an Administrator. This causes the signed applet not to write and delete  files in   specific medium and high integrity level directories.</p>
<p>If you run a signed applet in Windows Vista, a dialog box with a
security warning appears. Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Run</span>,
to allow the applet to run with all permissions except write or delete
permissions for files on
local
drive. </p>
<h2><a name="secureversioning"></a>Secure Versioning</h2>
<p>Java applets using Java SE 5.0 Update 6 or earlier  versions could specify the exact version of the JRE on  which they can be run. This allowed  Java applets to run with a JRE that might not have the latest security fixes.</p>
<p>  Java SE 6   allows all the applets to be  executed with the latest installed JRE version.This is a new enhancement that provides additional security.</p>
