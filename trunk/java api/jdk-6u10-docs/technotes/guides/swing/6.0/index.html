<a name=Major><h2>Major Features</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<a name=LAF><h3>Platform Look and Feel Improvements</h3></a> 
<blockquote>
	<p>Both GTK and Windows look and feels were enhanced and improved by taking advantage of native rendering engines.     
All Swing components appear in accordance with the underlying platform's look and feel, provide appropriate feedback and have the correct size.
</blockquote>	
	<a name=SwingWorker>
	<h3>SwingWorker </h3>
	</a> 
<blockquote>
     <p>An abstract class <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingWorker.html">javax.swing.SwingWorker</a> was added to the JDK. The <code>SwingWorker</code> class enables a long-running task to be executed on a background thread. A subclass of <code>SwingWorker</code> must implement the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingWorker.html#doInBackground()"><code>doInBackground()</code></a> method, which performs the background computation. While the background task is being executed,  the event dispatch thread   processes events and provides any necessary updates to the UI. The <code>SwingWorker</code> class supports intermediate results. The background task can invoke  the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingWorker.html#publish(V...)"><code>publish</code></a> method, which sends partial data  to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingWorker.html#process(java.util.List)"><code>process</code></a>
     method for processing on the event dispatch thread. In addition, the <code>SwingWorker</code> class supports property change listeners. Any change of a property triggers an event,  which invokes event-handling methods on the event dispatch thread. 
     <p>The use of the SwingWorker is  recommended  to accomplish  time-consuming tasks. For  details, see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html">Concurrency in Swing</a> section of the Swing tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="TextPrint"><h3>Text Printing</h3></a>
<blockquote>
  <p> Several new methods of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/text/JTextComponent.html">javax.swing.JTextComponent</a> class  provide printing support for text documents. Supported formats include HTML, RTF, and plain text. The new API allows you to print the entire contents of a text component regardless of whether the component is visible or not. Features include printing interactively or non-interactively, displaying a print dialog,  adding  custom headers or footers, and automatic layout and pagination. The document content is formatted to fit the page size.
  <p>The new API includes the following methods: 
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/text/JTextComponent.html#print()">boolean print()</a> 
  <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/text/JTextComponent.html#print(java.text.MessageFormat,%20java.text.MessageFormat)">boolean print(MessageFormat, MessageFormat)</a> 
  
  <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/text/JTextComponent.html#print(java.text.MessageFormat,%20java.text.MessageFormat,%20boolean,%20javax.print.PrintService,%20javax.print.attribute.PrintRequestAttributeSet,%20boolean)">boolean print(MessageFormat, MessageFormat, boolean, PrintService, PrintRequestAttributeSet, boolean)</a> 
  
  <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/text/JTextComponent.html#getPrintable(java.text.MessageFormat,%20java.text.MessageFormat)">Printable getPrintable(MessageFormat,MessageFormat)</a> 
  </ul>
For  details, see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/printtext.html">How to Print Text</a> section of the Swing tutorial.</blockquote>
<a name="JTableSortFilter"><h3>JTable Sorting and Filtering</h3></a>
<blockquote>
<p> To provide sorting and filtering capabilities, several new classes were added to the JDK. The basis for sorting and filtering is provided by the abstract <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/RowSorter.html">RowSorter</a> class. The <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/DefaultRowSorter.html">DefaultRowSorter</a> class is an implementation of the <code>RowSorter</code>  class that deals with grid-based models. The <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/table/TableRowSorter.html">TableRowSorter</a> class was added to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/table/package-summary.html">javax.swing.table</a> package as an implementation of the <code>RowSorter</code> class for JTables. The <code>TableRowSorter</code> class enables you to specify  different <code>Comparator</code>s  and also provides a filtering option. 
<p>For  details, see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/table.html#sorting">How to Use Tables</a> section of the Swing tutorial.</blockquote>
<a name="Layout"><h3>Layout Enhancements
</h3>
</a>
<blockquote>
  <p>The new API is intended for developers who write layout managers and includes the following two  features: an ability to get the baseline for components and an ability to get the preferred spacing between components.</p>
  <p>Professional layouts typically align components along their baseline. Previously, Swing  provided no means to get the baseline of components. As a solution to this problem, the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#getBaseline(int,%20int)">getBaseline(int,int)</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#getBaselineResizeBehavior()">getBaselineResizeBehavior()</a> methods were added to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html">javax.swing.JComponent</a> class to get the baseline and the baseline behavior when a component's size changes.
  </p>
  <p>Each look and feel provides  different guidelines regarding how far components should be placed from each other. In order to create a cross platform look and feel there should be 
  an API for  getting this information. As a solution, the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/LayoutStyle.html">javax.swing.LayoutStyle</a> class was added. Layout managers can use this class to determine the preferred amount of space to place  between components. 

Look and feel authors can provide a custom LayoutStyle by overriding the <code>getLayoutStyle()</code> method of the look and feel.
</blockquote>


<a name="Tabs"><h3>Arbitrary Components as Tabs of JTabbedPane</h3></a>
<blockquote>
	<p> Prior to release 6, the content of a tabbed pane's tab was limited to a string or an icon (or both). The new API allows you to add custom components to tabs. The most common use of this feature is to add close buttons that  remove tabs from tabbed panes.  The following new methods were added to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JTabbedPane.html">javax.swing.JTabbedPane</a> class:
	<ul>
	<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JTabbedPane.html#setTabComponentAt(int,%20java.awt.Component)">setTabComponentAt(int, Component)</a> 
	<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JTabbedPane.html#getTabComponentAt(int)">getTabComponentAt(int)</a> 
	<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JTabbedPane.html#indexOfTabComponent(java.awt.Component)">indexOfTabComponent(Component)</a> 
	</ul>
	<p>For  details, see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/tabbedpane.html">How to Use Tabbed Panes</a> section of the Swing tutorial.</blockquote>
<a name="DoubleBuffering"><h3>True Double Buffering</h3></a>
<blockquote> Previously, when a Swing based application was exposed after being hidden by another application,  there  was a noticeable delay between the moment when the background of the window was erased and the moment when the window   painted. The problem has been resolved with adding true double buffering to Swing.
  <p> Each window has an off-screen image that is synchronised with the corresponding on-screen image. As  a  window is exposed, its off-screen image is directly copied on the toolkit thread to the screen. Another   benefit applies to applications that block the event dispatch thread. If a user hides and then exposes an application window, the application still paints while   the EDT is being blocked.     
    <p>In addition, the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/RepaintManager.html">RepaintManager</a> class now handles painting for Swing top-level components (<code>JApplet</code>, <code>JWindow</code>, <code>JFrame</code>, and <code>JDialog</code>) and  supports new painting architecture based on a component's location in the window. The following new methods were added to the <code>RepaintManager</code> class:     
  <ul>
	<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/RepaintManager.html#addDirtyRegion(java.applet.Applet,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int)">addDirtyRegion(Applet, int, int, int, int)</a> 
	<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/RepaintManager.html#addDirtyRegion(javax.swing.JComponent,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int)">addDirtyRegion(JComponent, int, int, int, int)</a>
   	<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/RepaintManager.html#addDirtyRegion(java.awt.Window,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int)">addDirtyRegion(WIndow, int, int, int, int)</a>
  </ul>
  <p>All Swing top-level components  override   the <code>repaint</code> method, which calls the appropriate <code>addDirtyRegion</code> method. </p>
  <p>The <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JRootPane.html">JRootPane</a> class now overrides the <code>setDoubleBuffered</code> method, which defines whether this component  should use a  buffer for painting or not. </p>

</blockquote>
<a name=GroupLayout>
<h3> GroupLayout Layout Manager </h3>
</a> 
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/GroupLayout.html">GroupLayout</a>  layout manager was added to the <code>javax.swing</code> package. This layout was developed for the GUI builder  provided with the NetBeans IDE. The <code>GroupLayout</code> is primarily intended for use by  GUI builders but  may be  hand-coded as well.
<p>For  details, see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/layout/group.html">How to Use GroupLayout</a> section of the Swing tutorial.
</blockquote>
<a name="Dnd">
<h3>Drag and Drop  Enhancements</h3>
</a>
<blockquote>
  <p>Two  major enhancements  were introduced   to the Drag and Drop feature in release 6.   
  <p>First,  the Drag and Drop operation can be configured  not to use a selection for showing a drop location (refer to the Bug Database, bug ID <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4468566.html"> 4468566</a>.) The new mechanism introduces the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/DropMode.html">DropMode</a> property  for  components that support drops such as <code>JTree</code>, <code>JTable</code>, <code>JList</code>, and <code>JTextComponent</code>. The <code>DropMode</code> property is used to determine the mode by which a component tracks and indicates a drop location. To set this property for a component, the <code>setDropMode(DropMode)</code> method was added to  the component's class  for each component mentioned above. Listed below are available drop modes and the components that support them:  
  <ul>
<li><code>ON</code> - <code>JList</code>, <code>JTree</code>, <code>JTable</code>
<li><code>INSERT</code> - <code>JList</code>, <code>JTree</code>, <code>JTable</code>, <code>JTextComponent</code>
<li><code>ON_OR_INSERT</code> - <code>JList</code>, <code>JTree</code>, <code>JTable</code>
<li><code>ON_OR_INSERT_ROWS, ON_OR_INSERT_COLS</code> - <code>JTable</code>
<li><code>USE_SELECTION</code> - <code>JList</code>, <code>JTree</code>, <code>JTable</code>, <code>JTextComponent</code>
  </ul>
  <p>For backward compatibility the default value of this property is set to <code>USE_SELECTION</code>. To take advantage of the improved Drag and Drop feature, use one of the other drop modes mentioned above. </p>
  <p> The second enhancement involves  the <code>TransferHandler</code> class with regard to   handling drop operations. Previously, the <code>TransferHandler</code> class was unable  to accomplish common drop-related tasks  since import handling methods lacked  necessary information.  The new <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/TransferHandler.TransferSupport.html">TransferHandler.TransferSupport</a>  inner class  provides  details on every transfer operation. 
  <p>New overloaded versions of
    the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/TransferHandler.html#canImport(javax.swing.TransferHandler.TransferSupport)">canImport</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/TransferHandler.html#importData(javax.swing.TransferHandler.TransferSupport)">importData</a> methods 
    were added to the <code>TransferHandler</code> class.  These 
    methods take an instance of the <code>TransferSupport</code> class and thus allow developers to accept or reject transfers based on the details of the transfer. Developers can also customize   drop behavior based on  a <code>Transferable</code>, a drop location, or a drop action associated with a transfer  retrieved from  the <code>TransferSupport</code> instance. 
    For example, the new <code>canImport</code> method can  be implemented to detect an attempt to move data from a child to its parent and  reject such a transfer. Unlike previous versions, the <code>canImport</code> method is called continuously by a component's <code>TransferHandler</code>, while a drag and drop operation
    takes place  over the component. This feature provides the mechanism by which  the acceptability of a transfer can be changed many times during the operation.
  For backward compatibility, the old version of the <code>canImport</code> method is called by the new version by default.<p>Another improvement includes  addition of TransferHandler support to top-level components. This support is provided by means of 
  the <code>setTransferHandler</code> and <code>getTransferHandler</code> methods added to the class of each top-level component  (<code>JApplet</code>, <code>JWindow</code>, <code>JFrame</code>, and <code>JDialog</code>).  
  <p>Previously  users had to make a selection first and then  click the selected item again to initiate a drag operation. Now a drag operation is initiated with a single mouse click (refer to the Bug Database, bug ID <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4521075.html"> 4521075</a>.)
 
  <p>For details, see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/dnd/index.html">Drag an Drop and Data Transfer</a> section of the Swing tutorial.

<a name=Misc><h2>Miscellaneous Changes</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<a name=ButtonGroup>
<h3>Ability to Reset a ButtonGroup to an Unselected State</h3>
</a> 
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>ButtonGroup</code> class is used to create a multiple-exclusion scope for a set of buttons. Initially all buttons in a group are unselected.  Previously there  was no way to return to  the unselected state after selecting a button. Now the  <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/ButtonGroup.html#clearSelection()">clearSelection</a> method allows  developers to clear the selection so that none of the buttons in the group are selected.
</blockquote>
<a name=ActionKeys>
<h3>New Constants for the javax.swing.Action Interface</h3>
</a> 
<blockquote>
<p>The following constants were added to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/Action.html">Action</a> interface. 
<ul>
<li><code>SELECTED_KEY</code><BR>
This key is used to store the selected state of a component. It is used for components with meaningful selection state such as <code>JRadioButton</code> and <code>JCheckBox</code> instances.
<li><code>DISPLAYED_MNEMONIC_INDEX_KEY</code><BR>
This key is used to specify an index in the text at which a mnemonic decoration should be  placed.
<li><code>LARGE_ICON_KEY</code><BR>
This key is used to store an icon.
</ul>
The  <code>hideActionText</code> property determines whether a button displays the text from the <code>Action</code>. To set and get this property, the following new methods were added      to the <code>AbstractButton</code> class: <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/AbstractButton.html#setHideActionText(boolean)">setHideActionText(boolean)</a> and  <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/AbstractButton.html#getHideActionText()">getHideActionText()</a> correspondingly.

</blockquote>
<a name=Parentless>
<h3>Support for True Parentless JDialogs</h3>
<blockquote>
In JDK 5.0 and earlier versions, the following line of code threw an exception:</p>
<p><code>JDialog d = new JDialog((Dialog)null);</code>
<p>Swing only allowed  you to pass <code>null</code> to the constructor <code>JDialog(Frame):</code></p>
<p><code>JDialog d = new JDialog((Frame)null);</code>
<p>In the latter case an invisible shared-owner frame was a parent for all parentless JDialogs. </p>
<p>With  the new <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/modality.html">Modality</a> model  added to the JDK 6, AWT allows creation of truly parentless dialogs. This means that   <code>d.getParent()</code> returns <code>null</code> for these dialogs. To make use of new modality API, JDialogs also need to be truly parentless (refer to the Bug Database, bug ID <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/6300062.html"> 6300062</a>.)</p>
<p>New constructors with a <code>Window</code> parameter as an owner were added to the <code>JDialog</code> class and a new method was added to  the <code>JOptionPane</code> class. To create a parentless JDialog, you can now pass <code>null</code> to either of constructors <code>JDialog(Dialog)</code> or <code>JDialog(Window)</code>. To create a parentless JOptionPane, use the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JOptionPane.html#createDialog(java.lang.String)">createDialog(String)</a> method.
<p>As a summary, have a look at the   three constuctors below:
<p><code>JDialog d = new JDialog((Dialog)null)</code>;
<p><code>JDialog d = new JDialog((Window)null)</code>;
<p><code>JDialog d = new JDialog((Frame)null)</code>;
<p>Note the  difference: although all three constructors  take <code>null</code>, only the first two dialogs are truly parentless and the operation  <code>d.getParent()</code> returns <code>null</code> for them. For the third dialog  <code>d.getParent()</code> returns the shared-owner frame.
