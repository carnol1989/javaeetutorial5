<h2><a name="http"></a>HTTP, FTP, and GOPHER </h2>
<p>Java Plug-in supports HTTP, FTP, and GOPHER protocols, including built-in proxy 
  configuration support.</p>
<h2><a name="https"></a>HTTPS</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>HTTPS is supported in Java Plug-in through Java Secure Socket Extension (JSEE), 
  which provides a Java implementation of SSL and HTTPS for the Java platform. 
</p>
<h3>Error handling support </h3>
<p>When accessing an HTTPS server, errors may occur. Java Plug-in has hooked into 
  JSSE to provide the following types of error handling: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Hostname mismatch:</i> If the HTTPS server host name does not match the 
    name on the server certificate, a warning dialog will appear.&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Untrusted server certificate:</i> If the server certificate can not be 
    verified during the SSL handshaking, a warning dialog will appear.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Untrusted client certificate:</i> In case client authentication is required 
    by the server and the client certificate cannot be verified, a warning dialog 
    will be appear.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Server authentication:</i> If the client accesses a protected directory 
    on the HTTPS server, the users will be prompted for a username and password. 
    <font size="4"> <b>Note:</b></font> Only basic authentication is currently 
    supported. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Potential issues with HTTPS through JSSE </h3>
<p>Although support of HTTPS through JSSE eliminates many browser-specific problems, 
  there are several issues that developers should be aware of: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Untrusted server certificate: </i>When SSL handshaking takes place in 
    establishing an HTTPS connection, the server certificate is verified against 
    the root CA store in Java SE. However, Java SE supports fewer root CA certificates 
    than does the browser. As a result, you may have problems with untrusted server 
    certificates.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Client authentication:</i> Java Plugin supports browser keystore in  JRE 1.5 or later. With browser keystore client authentication of HTTPS server is  performed differently for  Internet  Explorer and Mozilla family  browsers. For Internet Explorer the certificate is not imported into the JRE keystore. For Mozilla family browsers, a JSS package should be installed to read the certificate from the Mozilla keystore. By default browser keystore support is turned on.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Level of error handling:</i> Java Plug-in currently handles the types 
    of error listed in the previous section. However, if there are additional 
    types of error that Java Plug-in doesn't recognize, the Java applet code may 
    break.&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="socks"></a>Socks</h2>
<p>Java Plug-in currently supports SOCKS version 4. </p>
<p><b><font size="4">Note:</font></b> For HTTP/HTTPS, a SOCKS proxy server may 
  be used with a web proxy server to add caching. The behavior, however, may differ 
  from that observed when running a similar configuration in a browser without 
  Java Plug-in.</p>
<h2><a name="ntlm"></a>NTLM Authentication</h2>
<p>Java Plug-in supports NTLM authentication protocol for HTTP/HTTPS. When attempting 
to access a server requiring NTLM authentication, the   following dialog  is displayed:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/NTLMauthentication.jpg" alt="NTLM Authentication required. Provide your username, password and domain name" width="344" height="348"></p>
<p>To authenticate enter  <strong>User Name</strong>, <strong>Password</strong> and the <strong>Domain</strong> in the respective fields.</p>
