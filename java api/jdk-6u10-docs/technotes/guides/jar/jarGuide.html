  <h2>What is JAR?</h2>

  <p>JAR stands for Java ARchive. It's a file format based on the
  popular ZIP file format and is used for aggregating many files
  into one. Although JAR can be used as a general archiving tool,
  the primary motivation for its development was so that Java
  applets and their requisite components (.class files, images and
  sounds) can be downloaded to a browser in a single HTTP
  transaction, rather than opening a new connection for each piece.
  This greatly improves the speed with which an applet can be
  loaded onto a web page and begin functioning. The JAR format also
  supports compression, which reduces the size of the file and
  improves download time still further. Additionally, individual
  entries in a JAR file may be digitally signed by the applet
  author to authenticate their origin.</p>

  <p>JAR is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the only archive format that is cross-platform</li>

    <li>the only format that handles audio and image files as well
    as class files</li>

    <li>backward-compatible with existing applet code</li>

    <li>an open standard, fully extendable, and written in
    java</li>

    <li>the preferred way to bundle the pieces of a java
    applet</li>
  </ul>

  <p>JAR consists of a zip archive, as defined by PKWARE,
  containing a manifest file and potentially signature files, as
  defined in the <a href="jar.html">JAR File Specification</a>.</p>

  <h2>The APPLET tag</h2>Changing the APPLET tag in your HTML page
  to accomodate a JAR file is simple. The JAR file on the server is
  identified by the <b>ARCHIVE</b> parameter, where the directory
  location of the jar file should be relative to the location of
  the html page:
  <pre>
    &lt;applet code=Animator.class 
      archive="jars/animator.jar"
      width=460 height=160&gt;
      &lt;param name=foo value="bar"&gt;
    &lt;/applet&gt;
</pre>Note that the familiar <b>CODE=myApplet.class</b> parameter
must still be present. The <b>CODE</b> parameter, as always,
identifies the name of the applet where execution begins. However,
the class file for the applet and all of its helper classes are
loaded from the JAR file.

  <p>Th ARCHIVE attribute describes one or more JAR files
  containing classes and other resources that will be "preloaded".
  The classes are loaded using an instance of an AppletClassLoader
  with the given CODEBASE. It takes the form
  <tt>archive&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>archiveList</em></tt>. The archives
  in <em>archiveList</em> are separated by ",".</p>

  <p>Once the archive file is identified, it is downloaded and
  separated into its components. During the execution of the
  applet, when a new class, image or audio clip is requested by the
  applet, it is searched for first in the archives associated with
  the applet. If the file is not found amongst the archives that
  were downloaded, it is searched for on the applet's server,
  relative to the CODEBASE (that is, it is searched for as in
  JDK1.0.2).</p>

  <p>The archive tag may specify multiple JAR files. Each JAR file
  must be separated by "," (comma). Each file is downloaded in
  turn:</p>
  <pre>
    &lt;applet code=Animator.class 
      archive="classes.jar ,  images.jar ,  sounds.jar"
      width=460 height=160&gt;
      &lt;param name=foo value="bar"&gt;
    &lt;/applet&gt;
</pre>There can be any amount of white space between entries within
the archive parameter. In addition, the archive tag itself is
case-insensitive; it can be lower-case, upper-case, or any
combination of lower- and upper-case letters, such as ArCHiVe.

  <h2>Executable JAR Files</h2>On Microsoft Windows systems, the
  Java 2 Runtime Environment's installation program will register a
  default association for JAR files so that double-clicking a JAR
  file on the desktop will automatically run it with
  <tt>javaw&nbsp;-jar</tt>. Dependent extensions bundled with the
  application will also be loaded automatically. This feature makes
  the end-user runtime environment easier to use on Microsoft
  Windows systems.

  <p>The Solaris 2.6 kernel has already been extended to recognize
  the special "magic" number that identifies a JAR file, and to
  invoke <tt>java -jar</tt> on such a JAR file as if it were a
  native Solaris executable. A application packaged in a JAR file
  can thus be executed directly from the command line or by
  clicking an icon on the CDE desktop.</p>
