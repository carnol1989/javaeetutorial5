This page summarizes enhancements to the jar and zip support provided in JDK 6.

<h2>API changes</h2>
<p>
Two new compressed streams have been added:

<ul>
<li>
<code>java.util.zip.DeflaterInputStream</code>: Data read from this stream is
compressed.
</li>

<li>
<code>java.util.zip.InflaterOutputStream</code>: Data written to this stream is
decompressed.
</li>
</ul>

For example, these can be useful if a client wants to send compressed data
over a network.

The data can be compressed into packets with <code>DeflaterInputStream</code>,
and those packets written over the network connection.

The receiving end then reads the compressed packets from the network
connection, and decompresses them by writing to an
<code>InflaterOutputStream</code>.

<h2>Implementation changes</h2>
<p>
On all platforms, zip files can contain more than 64k entries.

<p>
On Windows, some limitations have been removed:
<ul>
<li>
File names longer than 256 characters are now supported.
</li>

<li>
The limitation of just over 2,000 simultaneously open zip files has been
removed.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to the <code>jar</code> command</h2>
<p>
There are two changes to the behavior of the <code>jar</code> command:

<ul>
<li>
The timestamps of extracted files are those listed in the archive, instead of
the time of extraction.
</li>

<li>
When creating a jar, it is possible to specify the entry point for stand-alone
applications bundled into an executable jar file.

The 'e' option specifies the application entry point by creating or overriding
the Main-Class attribute value in the jar file's manifest.
</li>
</ul>
