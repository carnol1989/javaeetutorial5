<p>The term &quot;Java Web apps&quot; includes web-based Java apps like applets
  and Java Web Start applications. The term &quot;Java Web&quot; encompasses 
  those technologies, along with the technologies that distribute and update
  the JRE over the web. </p>
<p>Since the applet developers guide is being rewritten, it's location is moving 
  from guides/plugin to <tt>guides/jweb/applet_dev</tt>. </p>
<p>At some point, the Java Web Start Developers guide should move to a similar
   location, like <tt>guides/jweb/javaws_dev</tt>.</p>
<p>At the moment, the previous &quot;plugin&quot; guide remains intact, with a 
  note that says it's deprecated and a pointer to the replacement. But when it 
  goes away, a redirect should be put in its place.</p>
<p>Similarly, the previous &quot;deployment&quot; guide reamins intact, with a 
  note and a pointer. When it goes away, there should be a redirect for it, too.</p>
