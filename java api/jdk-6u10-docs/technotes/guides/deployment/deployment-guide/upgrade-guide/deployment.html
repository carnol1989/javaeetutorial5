<h1>Internet/Intranet Deployment of the Sun Java<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> Runtime Environment (JRE<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup>) Software</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Internet deployment</h2>
<p>If you would like to have your internet customers download Sun JRE to run your applets inside Internet Explorer, you should consider hosting the Java technology logos at your web site. More information is available about the logos at:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <a href="http://logos.sun.com/logosite.jsp?Category=third#java"><code>http://logos.sun.com/logosite.jsp?Category=third#java</code></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p> When users click on any one of these logos, a security dialog box pops-up the screen to confirm whether the user would like to install and run Java Plug-in, signed and distributed 
  by Sun Microsystems. If they agree to install, the browser will download and 
  launch the installer. The user will have to go through a few installer dialogs 
  to successfully install Java Plug-in on their system. After the successfull installation, 
  the browser will display a confirmation message,
  and the system tray will contain a Java icon, indicating the system is running the Sun JRE.</p>
<h2> Intranet deployment</h2>
<p>You can distribute Sun JRE to intranet users by hosting the <code>.msi</code>
  file on an internal web site and asking users to launch the installer through 
  <code>msiexec</code>. The other option is to install the JRE through Active 
  Directory. If you are using Active Directory, you may have to customize the 
  <code>.msi</code> file, which is known as creating a transform.</p>
<p>You can obtain the <code>.msi</code> file for the JRE installer by installing
  the JRE offline Windows installer. After installation, the <code>.msi</code> file,
  <code>jre1.6.0.msi</code>, will
  be available in the directory <code><i> AppDataFolder\jre1.6.0</i></code>, where<code><i> AppDataFolder</i></code><em><code> </code></em>is the user's &quot;Application Data&quot;
  folder (typically something like <code>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>username</i>\Application Data</code>),
  and <i>CLSID</i> is a long string like <code>7148F0A6-6813-11D6-A77b-00B0D0142010</code>,
  depending on the release.</p>
