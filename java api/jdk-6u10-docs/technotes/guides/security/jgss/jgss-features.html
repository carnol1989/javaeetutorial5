<h2>
Java Generic Security Services (Java GSS) and Kerberos
Enhancements for Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> SE 6
</h2>

<p>The following enhancements were added to the Java GSS/Kerberos implementation in Java SE 6. 

<!-- Please send feedback related to these new features to java-security@sun.com. -->

</p>
<!-- insert new detailed copy here -->

<ul>
<li><b>Support for AES encryption type </b><br> <br>

J2SE 5.0 supports DES and Triple DES encryption type, with following aliases: <br> <br> <code>
        des-cbc-md5 <br>
        des-cbc-crc <br>
        des3-cbc-sha1 <br>  <br> </code>

Starting from Java SE 6, support for AES encryption type (AES128 and AES256) in Java GSS/Kerberos is available. This improves interoperability of the Java SE Kerberos implementation with other Kerberos implementations, such as Solaris 10 and MIT Kerberos. <br> <br>

AES encryption type is specified in the Kerberos configuration file under the <code>libdefaults</code> section. It is specified as follows, with following tags: <code>default_tkt_enctypes, default_tgs_enctypes, permitted_enctypes.</code> <br> <br>

(AES128 encryption type) <br> <br> <code>
        aes128-cts <br>
        aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96 <br> <br></code>

(AES256 encryption type) <br> <br> <code>
        aes256-cts <br>
        aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 <br> <br> </code>

<b>NOTE:</b> The JCE framework within JDK includes an ability to enforce restrictions regarding the 
cryptographic algorithms and maximum cryptographic strengths available to applications.
Such restrictions are specified in "jurisdiction policy files". The jurisdiction policy 
files bundled in Java SE limits the maximum key length. 
Hence, in order to use AES256 encryption type, you will need to install the JCE crypto 
policy with the unlimited version to allow AES with 256-bit key. <br> <br>

For example, the <code>libdefaults</code> section in the configuration file might include the following. <br> <br>
<code>
default_tkt_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc <br>
default_tgs_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc <br>
permitted_enctypes   = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc <br> <br> </code>

<code>default_tkt_enctypes </code> is used to specify the encryption types to use for the session key in the ticket-granting-ticket. It is used by the client to restrict the encryption types of session keys that will be used to communicate with the KDC. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts </code>. <br> <br>

<code>default_tgs_enctypes </code> is used to specify the encryption types to use for the session key in service tickets. It is used by the client to restrict the encryption types of session keys that are shared by the client and server. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code>. <br> <br>

<code>permitted_enctypes </code> is used to specify the encryption types permitted to be used by a service. It is used by the server to restrict the encryption types of session keys that it will accept. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code>.</li> <br> 

<!-- ======================================= -->
 <br>
<li><b>Support for RC4-HMAC encryption type </b> <br> <br>

J2SE 5.0 already supports DES and Triple DES encryption type, with following aliases: <br><code>
        des-cbc-md5 <br>
        des-cbc-crc <br>
        des3-cbc-sha1 <br> <br> </code>

Starting from Java SE 6, support for RC4-HMAC encryption type in Java GSS/Kerberos is available. This improves interoperability of the Java SE Kerberos implementation with other Kerberos implementations, such as Windows, Solaris 10 and MIT Kerberos. Windows Active Directoiory supports RC4-HMAC as the default Kerberos encryption type. <br> <br>

RC4-HMAC encryption type is specified in the Kerberos configuration file under the <code>libdefaults</code> section. It is specified as follows, with following tags: <code>default_tkt_enctypes, default_tgs_enctypes, permitted_enctypes.</code> <br> <br><code>
       rc4-hmac <br>
       arcfour-hmac <br>
       arcfour-hmac-md5 <br> <br> </code>

For example, the libdefaults section in the configuration file might include the following. <br> <br><code>

default_tkt_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 rc4-hmac des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc <br>
default_tgs_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 rc4-hmac des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc <br>
permitted_enctypes   = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 rc4-hmac des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc <br> <br> </code>

<code>default_tkt_enctypes </code> is used to specify the encryption types to use for the session key in the ticket-granting-ticket. It is used by the client to restrict the encryption types of session keys that will be used to communicate with the KDC. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc rc4-hmac des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code> <br> <br>

<code>default_tgs_enctypes </code> is used to specify the encryption types to use for the session key in service tickets. It is used by the client to restrict the encryption types of session keys that are shared by the client and server. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc rc4-hmac des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code>. <br> <br>

<code>permitted_enctypes  </code>is used to specify the encryption types permitted to be used by a service. It is used by the server to restrict the encryption types of session keys that it will accept. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc rc4-hmac des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code>. <br> <br>

<!-- ======================================= -->

<li><b>Support for SPNEGO in Java GSS </b> <br> <br>

Java SE now supports SPNEGO mechanism in Java GSS.  <br> <br>

Java GSS is a framework that can support multiple security mechanisms;
however GSS-API does not prescribe the method by which GSS-API peers 
can establish whether they have a common security mechanism.
The Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation (SPNEGO) mechanism
is a pseudo security mechanism that enables GSS-API peers
to securely negotiate a common security mechanism to be used.
The SPNEGO protocol is used to negotiate which security mechanism 
should be adopted. <br> <br>

Currently Java GSS applications specify a unique object identifier (OID) 
to select the underlying security mechanism. For e.g. Java GSS applications 
specify Kerberos mechanism <code>OID "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2 </code> to use Kerberos mechanism.
<code>Oid mechOid = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2"); </code><br> <br>

To select SPNEGO security mechanism, Java GSS applications would need to
specify the SPNEGO mechanism <code>OID "1.3.6.1.5.5.2". </code>
<code>Oid mechOid = new Oid("1.3.6.1.5.5.2); </code><br> <br>

Support for SPNEGO improves interoperability with Microsoft products.
SPNEGO protocol is heavily used to interoperate with Microsoft server over HTTP, 
to support HTTP-Based Cross-Platform Authentication via the Negotiate Protocol.
Java SE now supports SPNEGO authentication scheme in HTTP as well.
Please check list of new networking features for Java SE 6. <br> <br>

<!-- ======================================= -->

<li><b>Support for new Pre-Authentication mechanisms </b> <br> <br>

 Java SE now includes support for the new pre-authentication mechanisms.  <br> <br>

 Kerberos is a protocol for verifying the identity of principals.
 The Kerberos protocol provides a mechanism called pre-authentication
 for proving the identity of a principal and for better protecting
 the long-term secret of the principal. <br> <br>

 Kerberos specification defines a framework for Kerberos 
 pre-authentication mechanisms. Lastest Kerberos specification defines
 new pre-authentication mechanisms to notify the client which 
 key to use, salt updates, and other additional parameters.
 The new pre-authentication mechanisms indicate a requirement 
 for additional pre-authentication. <br> <br>

 With the support of new pre-authentication mechanisms, Java GSS/Kerberos
 client can now handle the salt value updates when required.  <br> <br>

<!-- ======================================= -->

<li><b>Native platform GSS integration </b> <br> 

<p>This feature allows Java applications to take advantage of features in native GSS implementation available on the platform. To enable Java GSS to delegate to the native GSS library and its list of native mechanisms, set the system property "sun.security.jgss.native" to true. When enabled, Java GSS would look for native GSS library using the operating system specific name, e.g. Solaris: libgss.so vs Linux: libgssapi.so. If the desired GSS library has a different name or is not located under a directory for system libraries, then its full path should be specified using the system property "sun.security.jgss.lib".

<p>For Java SE 6, the native GSS support is limited to Solaris and Linux. Setting these system properties on platforms which native GSS integration is not supported will be ignored.

<p>Unlike the default Java GSS implementation which relies on JAAS KerberosLoginModule for initial credential acquisition, when using native GSS, the initial credential should be acquired beforehand, e.g. kinit, prior to calling JGSS APIs.

<p>In addition, when performing operations as a particular Subject, e.g. Subject.doAs(...) or Subject.doAsPrivileged(...), the to-be-used GSSCredential should be added to Subject's private credential set. Otherwise, the GSS operations will fail since no credential is found.  <br> 
</li>
<li><b>JAAS Login Entry Names Changes</b>
<br><br>The JAAS login entry names for both SunJSSE and JGSS are unified, and can be specified separately for different mechanisms. For Kerberos 5, the names are
<blockquote><pre>
com.sun.security.jgss.krb5.initiate
com.sun.security.jgss.krb5.accept
</pre></blockquote>
</li></ul>

<h2>
Java Generic Security Services (Java GSS) and Kerberos
Enhancements for J2SE 5.0
</h2>

<!--

Fixed 4837364: KerberosLoginModule should support TGT renews
Fixed 4642044: add SunJSSE support for the Kerberos cipher suites
	(com.sun.net.ssl.client/com.sun.net.ssl.server index names
	for Krb5LoginModule)
-->




<p>
The following enhancements were added to the Java GSS/Kerberos implementation in J2SE 5.0.
<!-- Please send feedback related to these new features to 
<a href=mailto:java-security@sun.com>java-security@sun.com</a> -->

<ul>
<li><B>Support for Triple DES encryption type.</B><BR>

Prior to J2SE 5.0, only the DES encryption type was supported. J2SE 5.0 
supports both DES and Triple DES encryption type.  This improves
interoperability of the Java SE Kerberos implementation with other
Kerberos implementations, such as Solaris 10 and MIT Kerberos.
<P>
Triple DES encryption type is specified in the Kerberos configuration
file under the "<TT>libdefaults</TT>" section.  It is specified as
"<TT>des3-cbc-sha1</TT>" with following tags: <TT>default_tkt_enctypes</TT>,
<TT>default_tgs_enctypes</TT>, <TT>permitted_enctypes</TT>.  
"<TT>dec3-cbc-sha1</TT>" has the following aliases:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
des3-hmac-sha1
des3-cbc-sha1-kd
des3-cbc-hmac-sha1-kd
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

For example, the libdefaults section in the configuration file might
include the following.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
default_tkt_enctypes = des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
default_tgs_enctypes = des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
permitted_enctypes   = des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>default_tkt_enctypes</TT> is used to specify the encryption types to use
for the session key in the ticket-granting-ticket.  It is used by the
client to restrict the encryption types of session keys that will be
used to communicate with the KDC.  The default value is "<TT>des-cbc-md5
des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1</TT>"
<p>
<TT>default_tgs_enctypes</TT> is used to specify the encryption types to use
for the session key in service tickets. It is used by the client to
restrict the encryption types of session keys that are shared by the
client and server. The default value is "<TT>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
des3-cbc-sha1</TT>".
<p>
<TT>permitted_enctypes</TT> is used to specify the encryption types permitted
to be used by a service.  It is used by the server to restrict the
encryption types of session keys that it will accept.
The default value is "<TT>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1</TT>".
<p>

<li><B>TCP vs. UDP Preference Configuration</B><BR>

Java SE now supports the use of the "<TT>udp_preference_limit</TT>" property in
the Kerberos configuration file (<TT>krb5.conf</TT>).
<P>
When sending a message to the KDC, the Java SE Kerberos library will use
TCP if the size of the message is above <TT>udp_preference_list</TT>. If the
message is smaller than <TT>udp_preference_list</TT>, then UDP will be tried at
most three times. If the KDC indicates that the request is too big,
the Java SE Kerberos library will use TCP.
<P>

<li><B>IPv6 Support in Kerberos</B><BR>

Java SE now supports IPv6 addresses in Kerberos tickets.  Prior to J2SE
5, only IPv4 addresses were supported in tickets.
<P>


<li><strong>TGT Renewals</strong><br>

The <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jaas/">Java 
Authentication and Authorizaton Server (JAAS)</a>
Kerberos login module in JDK 5.0,
<a href="../../../../jre/api/security/jaas/spec/com/sun/security/auth/module/Krb5LoginModule.html"><tt>Krb5LoginModule</tt></a>,
 now supports Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) renewal.  This allows
long-running services to renew their TGT automatically without user
interaction or requiring the services to restart.  
<p>

With this feature, if <tt>Krb5LoginModule</tt> obtains an expired
ticket from the ticket cache, the TGT will be automatically renewed
and be added to Subject of the caller who requested the ticket.  If
the ticket cannot be renewed for any reason, then
<tt>Krb5LoginModule</tt> will use its configured callback handler to
retrieve a username and password to acquire a new TGT.

<p>
To use this feature, configure <tt>Krb5LoginModule</tt> to use the
ticket cache and set the newly introduced <tt>renewTGT</tt> option to
<tt>true</tt>. Here is an example of a JAAS login configuration file
that requests TGT renewal.
<blockquote><pre>
server {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
        principal=<em>principal@your_realm</em>
	useTicketCache=true
	renewTGT=true;
};
</pre></blockquote>

Note that if <tt>renewTGT</tt> is set to true, then
<tt>useTicketCache</tt> must also be set to true; otherwise, it
results in a configuration error.

<p>
<li><strong>Login Entry Names for SunJSSE</strong><br>

In JDK 5.0, the SunJSSE provider has added support for the Kerberos 
cipher suites,
as described in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2712.txt">RFC 2712</a>
and the <a href="../jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#WhatsNew">What's New in 
JSSE in J2SE 5.0</a> in the JSSE Reference Guide. 
The following JAAS login configuration index names are reserved for
this feature.

<blockquote><pre>
com.sun.net.ssl.server
com.sun.net.ssl.client
</pre></blockquote>

When a JSSE application uses the Kerberos cipher suites
without explicit JAAS program, the SunJSSE provider will use these
index names to find and configure the JAAS login module to acquire the
necessary Kerberos credentials.

For example, such an application might have the following JAAS
configuration file.

<blockquote><pre> com.sun.net.ssl.server {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
        principal=<em>service_principal@your_realm</em>
        useKeyTab=true
        keyTab=<em>keytab_name</em>
	storeKey=true;
};
</pre></blockquote>

If the entry is not found, the default "other" index name will be
used.  The service name for TLS is "host". For example, a TLS
service running on a machine named "raven.abc.com" in the realm named
"KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM" would have the service principal name
<blockquote><pre>
host/raven.abc.com@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM
</pre></blockquote>
There are no restrictions on the TLS client; it may use any valid
Kerberos principal name.
<p>
When a JSSE application uses the Kerberos cipher suites with
explicit JAAS program, it can use any index name, including the ones
listed above.
</ul>

<h2>New Features in Java<SUP><FONT size=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> GSS
for Java <SUP><FONT size=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.4.2  </h2>
  
  
  <UL>
    <LI><font size=+0><B>Configurable Kerberos Settings</B> <BR>The Kerberos Key Distribution 
    Center (KDC) name and realm settings are provided in the Kerberos 
    configuration file or via the system properties 
    <CODE>java.security.krb5.kdc</CODE> and 
    <CODE>java.security.krb5.realm</CODE>. In previous releases, changes to the 
    Kerberos configuration values would only take effect when an application was 
    restarted. 
    <P>In the 1.4.2 release of the Java platform, a new boolean option 
    <CODE>refreshKrb5Config</CODE> can be specified in the entry for 
    <CODE>Krb5LoginModule</CODE> in the JAAS configuration file. If this option 
    is set to <CODE>true</CODE>, the configuration values will be refreshed 
    before the <CODE>login</CODE> method of the <CODE>Krb5LoginModule</CODE> is 
    called. </font>
    <P></P>
    <LI><font size=+0><B>Support for Slave Kerberos Key Distribution Center</B> <BR>Kerberos 
    allows the use of slave KDCs so that if the master KDC is unavailable, the 
    slave KDCs will respond to user requests. In earlier releases of the Java SE, 
    Sun's implementation of Kerberos tried only the master KDC and would give up 
    if there was no response within the default KDC timeout specified in the 
    Kerberos configuration file, or 30 seconds if no timeout had been specified. 

    <P>With this 1.4.2 release, Sun's implementation of Kerberos will retry with 
    the slave KDC(s), if they are specified. The slave KDCs can be specified in 
    the Kerberos configuration file or via a list of KDCs separated by a colon 
    (<CODE>:</CODE>) in the system property <CODE>java.security.krb5.kdc</CODE>.</font> 

    <P></P>
    <LI><font size=+0><B>Support TCP for Kerberos Key Distribution Center Transport</B> 
    <BR>
    Sun's implementation of Kerberos implements Kerberos version 5 according to 
    <A href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1510.txt">RFC 1510</A> and uses 
    UDP transport for ticket requests. A new Internet draft updates this 
    RFC. One of the added features is required support for TCP as a 
    transport in addition to UDP. As a result, in cases where Kerberos 
    tickets exceed the UDP packet size limit, the KDC would return an 
    error code indicating that the request should be resent over TCP. 
    <P>
    In the current 1.4.2 release, Sun's implementation of Kerberos 
    now supports automatic fallback to TCP. Therefore, if the Kerberos 
    ticket request using UDP fails and the KDC returns the error code 
    <code>KRB_ERR_RESPONSE_TOO_BIG</code>, TCP is automatically the 
    default transport.
    <!-- <P>
    The current draft which updates RFC 1510, is available online: 
<A href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-clarifications-04.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-clarifications-04.txt</A>. 
    </P></font> --> </LI>

<P></P>
<LI><font size=+0>
<B>Kerberos Service Ticket in the Subject's Private Credentials</b>
<BR>

The Kerberos service ticket is now stored in the Subject's 
private credentials. 
This change allows application developers access 
to the service ticket so that it can be used outside 
the JGSS (for example, in native applications or 
for proprietary uses). In addition, the service ticket 
can now be reused if the application tries to establish 
a security context to the same service again. The 
service ticket should be valid for it to be reusable.
<P>
Previously, when using Java Generic Security 
Services (JGSS) over Kerberos V5, if the <code> 
<!-- <a href="/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/org/ietf/jgss/package-summary.html"> --> useSubjectCredsOnly <!-- </A> --></code> 
property was set to true, the Ticket Granting Ticket 
(TGT) was retrieved from the Subject and used to 
establish a GSS Security context. The service ticket 
obtained was not stored in the Subject. 

Now the service ticket is also stored in the 
Subject if <code>useSubjectCredsOnly</code> is true. 

<P>If a client 
application searches through the Subject's private 
credentials, in previous releases it would find only the 
TGT. As of this release, it also will find any Service 
ticket(s) obtained. 
<P>
The bug report associated with this change is 4688866.
