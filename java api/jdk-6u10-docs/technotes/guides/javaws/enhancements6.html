<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Java Web Start enhancements in version 6</H2>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><BR>
</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>JNLP Specification addition of the &lt;update&gt; element
	with its &quot;policy&quot; and &quot;check&quot; attributes. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">The new &lt;update&gt; element with
its &quot;policy&quot; and &quot;check&quot; attributes is now
supported. The update element describes the applications preferences
on how Java Web Start should check for updates on the web, and what
to do when it is known before launching that an update is
available.<BR>In the previous versions of Java Web Start, the
&lt;offline-allowed&gt; element was overloaded to mean two things.&nbsp;
First, it meant that the application was allowed to run in &quot;offline&quot;
mode. (An application can be run in offline mode either from the
command line by adding the &quot;-offline&quot; argument, or from the
Cache Viewer.)&nbsp; Second, it meant that attempts to check for
update before launching an application (when not run in offline mode)
could time out.&nbsp; When a check for update times out, the
application would be launched from the cache while the update check
continued in the background.<BR>With the advent of the &lt;update&gt;
element and its check attribute in 6.0, the &lt;offline-allowed&gt;
element no longer has this second meaning.&nbsp; The default values:&nbsp;
&lt;update check=&quot;timeout&quot;/&gt;.&nbsp; which is the same
behavior as previous versions where &lt;offline-allowed&gt; was
specified.&nbsp; For the behavior that previously used whenever
&lt;offline-allowed&gt; was omitted, you need to specify &lt;update
check=&quot;always&quot;/&gt;. A third value &lt;update
check=&quot;background&quot;/&gt; can be specified to always
immediately launch from the cache while spawning a check for update
in the background.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second attribute, &quot;policy&quot;,
is used to determine what to do when it is known before starting the
application that there is an update available.&nbsp; You can either
always get the update, or prompt the user. The policy attribute
values can be either &quot;always&quot; (this is default) ,
&quot;prompt-update&quot; or &quot;prompt-run&quot;.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>JNLP Specification relaxation of requirements for the
	DownloadService API.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">In the previous versions, the URLs
passed as arguments to all of the APIs were restricted to be URLs to
resources listed in the jnlp file(s) of the running application.&nbsp;
This restriction is changed such that there are no restrictions for
signed and trusted code, and the restriction on untrusted code is not
that it be listed in the jnlp file(s), but only that it be from the
same codebase.<BR>Further, URLs to jnlp file(s) themselves are
allowed, so that calling DownloadService.removeResource() can now be
used to remove a whole application from the cache, and
DownloadService.loadResource() can be used to import an
application.<BR>One effect of this change is that resources not
listed in any jnlp file can now be used in an application.&nbsp; For
example, after determining the locale is set to en_xx, an application
can then load resources_en_xx.jar using the DownloadService, without
listing all the available resource jars in the jnlp file. (Allowing
you to dynamically add support for more locales without changing the
jnlp file).</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Implementation of a SocketService</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in; margin-bottom: 0in">Another
significant specification change is a clarification in the definition
of the sandbox, that it is only the default sandbox, and that the
implementation is free to prompt the user to allow actions that
wouldn't be allowed by the sandbox.&nbsp; You already saw in 1.5.0
that this was done for printing, so that just by using the normal
printing api in awt, you could expand the sandbox to allow the
application to access the printer (if the user agreed). In 6.0 this
is also done for socket connections, so that if an untrusted
application attempts to connect to a url, the user can be prompted to
allow the connection.</P>
<UL><LI><P>New &lt;java&gt; element in jnlp file to replace &lt;j2se&gt;
	element. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">For jnlp files that will be used only
with Java Web Start version 6.0 or later, the &lt;java&gt; element
can be used to replace the &lt;j2se&gt; tag.&nbsp; (This is mainly
because the Java Platform Standard Edition is no longer called
j2se.)&nbsp; For backward compatibility, the &lt;j2se&gt; tag will
continue to work.&nbsp; The &lt;java&gt; element will be identical to
the &lt;j2se&gt; element..</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The &lt;association&gt; element now may contain the &lt;icon&gt;
	and &lt;description&gt; sub-elements.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">When creating file extension and mime
type associations with your Java Web Start application, you can now
specify a separate icon to be used for each association (as opposed
to using the default icon for the application).&nbsp; Now, you can
also specify a description.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Jar Indexing is fully supported now, and the JNLPClassLoader
	is now an instance of the URLClassLoader.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">The JNLPClassLoader was rewritten to
extend URLClassLoader.&nbsp; This gives several powerful advantages.&nbsp;
<BR>First, Jar Indexing is now fully supported.&nbsp; If you have
several jar files, and create a jar index in the main jar file that
indexes all the jar files, you can then mark each additional jar as
lazy, and it will not be downloaded until and unless a resource or
class in it is referenced.&nbsp; This makes the old part and package
elements unnecessary for insuring that lazy jars are not downloaded
prematurely.<BR>Second, since the JNLPClassLoader now extends
URLClassLoader, an Application can call getURLs() to get a list of
the jar elements that are listed in the jnlp files (or have been
downloaded using the DownloadService API, even if not listed in any
jnlp file, see above).<BR>Finally, the URL returned for calls to
ClassLoader.getResource() is now the proper JAR URL of the item on
the net.&nbsp; In previous versions, this URL returned was a jar url
of the file url item in the cache.&nbsp; By extending URLClassLoader,
the cached location (if it exists) is meaningless, and it allows Java
Web Start to operate without caching.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Enhanced icon support. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">Java Web Start now supports two new
icon formats, &quot;.png&quot;, and &quot;.ico&quot;.&nbsp; This
allows you to specify an icon that will not need to be translated
into a different format depending on its use.&nbsp; You can also now
specify kind=&quot;shortcut&quot;, and Java Web Start will now honor
the width and height hints. This means if you specify:<BR>&lt;icon
kind=&quot;shortcut&quot; href=&quot;menushortcut.ico&quot;
width=&quot;16&quot; height=&quot;16&quot;/&gt;<BR>&lt;icon
kind=&quot;shortcut&quot; href=&quot;desktopshortcut.ico&quot;
width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot;/&gt;<BR>you can specify
separate images for any desktop and menu shortcuts that are created.&nbsp;
(note: for desktop shortcuts, Java Web Start will use the icon whose
size is closer to 32X32, and for menu shortcuts Java Web Start will
use the icon whose size is closer to 16X16 )</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Enhanced support for Add/Remove program entries on Windows. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">The Windows Add/Remove program entries
for Java Web Start applications will now include the publisher,
publisher websight, install date, and application icon from the
information block of the jnlp file.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Desktop shortcut tooltips. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">Desktop shortcuts created by Java Web
Start will now use the &lt;description&gt; element in the jnlp file
to create a toolkit describing the application.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>JNLPDownloadServlet enhancements. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">The JnlpDownloadServlet now contains
both a $$hostname and a $$sight macro. The $$hostname macro is
expanded to contain the host name. The $$site macro is expanded to
contain the web site address without the WAR context portion.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The list of safe vm args and safe properties has been
	expanded. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">See the developers guide for the
current list of safe properties and vm args.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Several Command Line Interface (CLI) items have been changed
	or added. See the developers guide for the current Javaws CLI.</P>
</UL>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Enhancements Common to Java Web Start and Java
  Plug-in</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>All dialogs have been redesigned to be more user friendly.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">All of the dialogs and screens shown
by Java Web Start and Java Plug-in have been redesigned with help
from the User Experience team to be more user friendly, intuitive,
and accessible.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>DownloadEngine and cache consolidation and redesign. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">The entire caching mechanism and
download engine has been redesigned and consolidated between Java Web
Start and Java Plug-in.&nbsp; <BR>This brings several new features to
Java Web Start, previously available only in Java Plug-in and vice
versa.</P>
<UL>
	<LI>
	  <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Caching can be disabled now
	entirely via the Java Control Panel.<br>
    </P>
	<LI>The cache max size set in the JCP
	    is now honored in Java Web Start, and a cleanup thread may be
	    started by Java Web Start to removed LRU items from the cache when
    it is approaching the max size set by the user.     
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>The &quot;cache-control: no-cache&quot;
    HTTP header is now supported. &quot;no-cache&quot; means cached
    contents cannot be used without re-validation. When the no-cache
    directive is used , an update check is always made to make sure the
    cached content is the same as the server copy pointed to, by the
    resource URL. If so, cached copy can be used. If not, server copy
    will be downloaded. Expiration field is ignored, which means that
    even if the cached resource is not expired yet, update check will
    still be performed.      
  </UL>
<UL>
  <LI>The expiration-date will be honored.&nbsp; If a downloaded
    resource contains an expiration date, it will not be used after that
    date. 
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">Note: The format of the cache is
completely changed and should never be assumed.&nbsp; Any existing
code that assumed the previous format of the cache, for either Java
Web Start or Java Plug-in will no longer work.&nbsp; Existing
applications in the Java Web Start cache will be upgraded and
converted to the new cache format the first time you run a Java Web
Start application, or if you launch the cache viewer using &quot;javaws
-viewer&quot;. Likewise, the system cache will be upgraded and
converted to the new format the first time you launch Java Web Start
in system mode, or if you just launch &quot;javaws -system&quot;.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The Java Console is now excluded from modality. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">By using the new modality features
added by AWT in Java 6, you can interact with the Java Console even
when the Application displays a modal Dialog. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>New support for OCSP/CRL 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">Java Web Start and Java Java Plug-in
support CRL (Certificate Revocation Lists) and OCSP (Online
Certificate Status Protocol) for verifying the certificates.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>New Support for SSL/TSL 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">An Option has been added to the Java
Control Panel to select the default SSL handshaking protocol.<BR>The
default is set to SSLv3 and SSLv2, but then user or enterprise can
change it to TSL.<BR><BR><BR><BR>
