<h3>Enhancement to NetworkInterface</h3>
<blockquote>
Provides a number of new methods for accessing state and configuration 
information relating to a system's network adapters. 
This includes information such as the broadcast address, subnet mask, 
MAC addresses, and MTU size. See <a href="../../../api/java/net/NetworkInterface.html">java.net.NetworkInterface</a>
<p>
The new class <a href="../../../api/java/net/InterfaceAddress.html">
java.net.InterfaceAddress</a> encapsulates all information about a 
NetworkInterface's IP addresses, including the broadcast address, 
and subnet prefix length (subnet mask)
</blockquote>

<h3>Support for Internationalized Domain Names</h3>
<blockquote>
RFCs 3490, 3491, 3492, 3454 define a mechanism where domain names comprised of
characters in alphabets other than US ASCII can be stored in the DNS. 
An algorithm is defined which provides a conversion from arbitrary 
Unicode strings to and from a "mangled" ASCII form. This feature 
provides a new class <a href="../../../api/java/net/IDN.html">
java.net.IDN</a>, which allows applications
to do this conversion so that IDNs can be looked up via 
<a href="../../../api/java/net/InetAddress.html">java.net.InetAddress</a>.
</blockquote>

<h3>HTTP Negotiate authentication</h3>
<blockquote>
This adds support for the "Negotiate" HTTP authentication scheme 
defined by Microsoft. Negotiate allows multiple underlying authentication 
mechanisms to be supported, and in each instance, one of these 
mechanisms is chosen for use. Currently, Kerberos is the only 
supported mechanism. This feature is described in more detail
in the guide to <a href="http-auth.html">Http Authentication</a>.
</blockquote>

<h3>Cross platform NTLM</h3>
<blockquote>
Previously, the Microsoft defined NTLM authentication protocol for HTTP was
only supported on Windows. Now, this protocol is supported on all platforms.
</blockquote>

<h3>Default CookieManager implementation</h3>
<blockquote>
The CookieHandler class was added in 1.5, but no implementation was provided 
in java.net. This feature provides a simple extensible implementation 
which separates the storage of cookies from the policy surrounding their 
acceptance. The default manager provides a number of standard policies and 
a simple in-memory storage mechanism. User defined policies and storage 
mechanisms can be used with this implementation.

The following are the new classes related to this feature:

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../api/java/net/CookieManager.html">java.net.CookieManager</a>
<li><a href="../../../api/java/net/CookiePolicy.html">java.net.CookiePolicy</a>
<li><a href="../../../api/java/net/CookieStore.html">java.net.CookieStore</a>
<li><a href="../../../api/java/net/HttpCookie.html">java.net.HttpCookie</a>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Light-weight HTTP server</h3>
<blockquote>
This provides a simple set of classes and interfaces for building 
light-weight HTTP server applications. The feature defines
<a href="../../../jre/api/net/httpserver/spec/index.html">two new packages</a> com.sun.net.httpserver
and com.sun.net.httpserver.spi. The server supports HTTP and HTTPS.
